- 👋 Hi, I’m @lfun1 or Lisa Fung, a freshman at Stanford University studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
- 👀 I’m interested in probability theory, matrix theory, and tensor decompositions, as well as their applications in geographic human mobility and electrical grid systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the probability theory behind machine learning and tensor decomposition techniques. On the side, I'm soldering and designing small projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on converting MATLAB tensor decomposition functions into open-source Python code.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at lisafung@stanford.edu
