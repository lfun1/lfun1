- 👋 Hi, I’m @lfun1 or Lisa Fung, a Computer Science & Mathematics student at Stanford University.
- 🚀 I have multiple years of coding experience with Python, C++, and Java. I'm very familiar with optimized algorithms, advanced data structures, and machine learning.
- 🛠️ I’m working on machine learning for computer vision, embedded systems for radio/satellite communication, and data science for energy and geospatial risk predictions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning probability theory, matrix theory, and tensor decompositions, and exploring applications in electrical grid systems, smoke detection, and radio communication.
- 💞️ I’m leading a research project building radio sensor networks for sustainability and air quality sensing, and I'm open to potential collaborations.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at lisafung@stanford.edu
